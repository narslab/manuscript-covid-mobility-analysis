\section{Abstract}
In this paper we examine the effects of COVID-19 on mobility, segmented by transportation type, as well as social activity such as retail and recreation, workplaces and residential. We use time series data for approximately sixty countries on five continents to discover a statistically significant relationship between mobility and new COVID-19 cases. We hope that the findings of this paper will guide policymakers to adopt an appropriate set of measures in order to reduce the infection rate and ease social restrictions in a safe manner.

\section{Introduction}
COVID-19 has had a severe impact on mobility and social activities since initial reports of the disease emerged in late 2019.
By May 2020 most countries had implemented social distancing measures and imposed strict travel restrictions to curtail the spread of the virus
both within their borders and internationally.
According to \trbcite{bonaccorsi2020economic}, the international spread of the disease can be partially explained by risk perception,
mobility behavior and social media influences using a global vector autoregression (GVAR) modeling framework\cite{dees2007exploring}.
%Milani concludes that most countries learn from each other's social distancing response which can be partially explained by social networks.  
\trbcite{zhang2020pathways} confirm that human mobility is key to understanding the transmission pathways.
Using a mobility dataset of over 500,000 flights and over 100 million passengers,
the authors develop a dynamic network model using time-dependent border restrictions as exogenous variables.
\trbcite{mckenzie2020country} studied the patterns in 6 activity responses across 108 countries but this was an exploratory effort in comparison with government policies and it included no modeling attempt to explain COVID-19 outcomes.

Beyond these global studies, several city and country-specific simulations and models have been estimated to explain how activities, mobility (particularly transit) impact COVID-19 outcomes.
\trbcite{kumar2020activitybaseda} used an activity-based epidemiological framework to study how COVID-19 is propagated across various daily activities in car-dependent cities typically found in the US and Canada.
They quantified the effect of the transit network on COVID-19 spread and demonstrated the importance of work and home activities in the early and latter stages of the epidemic.
\trbcite{badr2020association} developed a generalized linear model to explain COVID-19 growth based on overall mobility changes at the county level in the US. Inter-county movements were factored in but impacts by mode or activity were not analyzed.
Given China's and then  Italy's prominence in the earlier stages of the pandemic, several studies have examined their mobility patterns \trbcite{
  kraemer2020effect,bonaccorsi2020economic,pepe2020covid19,carteni2020how}.
While these have been important for country-wide epidemiological studies, they have not provided knowledge on activity-based impacts.

Therefore, there remains an urgent need to understand the interdependencies between COVID-19 outcomes and human mobility and activity patterns.
Statistically significant models can yield insights to enable policymakers contain and recover from the ongoing pandemic.
Furthermore, these models can guide future decisions in containing the spread of future epidemics.
In this paper, we conduct a global scale country-level analysis of COVID-19 infections,  mobility and activity patterns.
First, we cluster the countries to discover patterns in mobility and activity changes.
Second, we estimate cluster-representative models using the vector autoregression (VAR) framework, allowing for time lags across all endogenous variables, and thus including dynamic interdependencies among them.
These models explain which activities impact COVID-19 outcomes and vice versa, providing potential pathways for understanding behavioral responses to the spread of the pandemic and a greater understanding of the disparities and similarities across nationwide outcomes.

%By assigning a value of zero or one to international mobility restrictions, Zhang et al discover a direct relationship between the transmission rates and the coefficients in the estimation outcome, i.e. positive coefficients indicate effectiveness. 

% \trbcite{forecasting} shed light on forecasting with Bayesian Global Vector Autoregressive Model. This statistical approach pertains to the impacts of mobility on COVID-19 due to its counterfactual nature; instead of treating observations in isolation B-GVAR accommodates variable interdependence and produces more robust forecasts. Country-specific models can be converted to a system of equations where all endogenous variables are stacked. Although taking into account international linkages improves the forecast, the optimal lag for each country still needs to be estimated and tested for stationarity 




\section{Data}
We use transportation data provided by Apple\footnote{\url{https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility}} along with Community Mobility Reports compiled by Google\footnote{\url{https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/}}. %The data is publicly available at:
The new confirmed cases global data set is provided by the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data initiative\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19}}.
Apple's data set focuses on transportation types (walking, driving, transit) whereas Google tracks movement trends by region and segments them into categories such as residential, workplace and transit. Our integrated data set captures changes in requests for directions from January 22 to July 14 as well as aggregated location data for a variety of categorized places. The data shows us the change in visitors from February 15 to July 12 compared to a baseline of days (January 3 - February 6, 2020). By tracking user requests of their Maps application, Apple contributes a snapshot of incidental trips as opposed to actual foot traffic which is the approach taken by Google for their Community Mobility Reports. 
The sources are summarized in \autoref{tab:sources} and the variables are described in \autoref{tab:variables}.
The integrated dataset (along with the code and plots generated for this paper) is publicly available on Github.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/narslab/covid-analysis/tree/master/mobility}}

\section{Methods}
First, we investigate patterns across the activity and mobility variables by clustering the countries across these nine dimensions.
We use dynamic time warping and hierarchical agglomerative clustering to obtain the clusters.
These yield preliminary insights into the trends at the country level.
Finally, we intend to estimate vector autoregression models at the country and at the cluster level in order to quantify how changes in activity and mobility trends influence COVID-19 outcomes. 
In particular, we expect results as well on interdependencies between the mobility and activity variables.

\subsection{Dynamic time warping}
The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm \trbcite{giorgino2009computing} computes the optimal distance between pairwise time series.
Any hierarchical clustering procedure requires a dissimilarity matrix as an input, which DTW provides.
First, we compute the Euclidean distance matrix for each country across the dimensions of the endogenous variables.
Second, we apply DTW to find the optimal matching between the countries based on their pairwise distance matrices across the dimensions observed.
The symmetric dissimilarity matrix is then used an input to the clustering algorithm.


\subsection{Clustering}
We use the Ward method \trbcite{murtagh2014ward}, which is a hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) approach, to group the countries.
The dendogram is shown in \autoref{fig:dend}.


% We use a Global Vector AutoRegression (GVAR) modeling framework \cite{dees2007exploring} (Carteni et al
% 2020).
% Given country $i$ with $k_{i}$ endogenous variables $x_{i,t}$, the model is specified as
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:1}
%   x_{i,t} = \sum_{l=1}^{p_{i}}\Phi_{il}x_{i,t-l} + \Lambda_{i0}x_{i,t}^{*} + \sum_{l=1}^{q_{i}} \Lambda_{il}x_{i,t-l}^{*} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
% \end{equation}
% where $i= 1, 2, \ldots, N$. The matrix $\Phi_{il}$ is the matrix of coefficients of size $k_{i}\times k_{i}$, while the matrix $\Lambda_{i0}$ and $\Lambda_{il}$ are $k_{i}\times k_{i}^{*}$ matrices, where $k_{i}^{*}$ is the number of foreign variables.

% We can stack the domestic and foreign variables as:
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:2}
%   z_{i,t} = [x_{i,t}', x_{i,t}^{*'}]'
% \end{equation}
% and then rewrite the model as :
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:3}
%   A_{i0}z_{i,t} = \sum_{i=1}^{p} A_{il}z_{i,t-l} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
% \end{equation}
% where
% \begin{align}
%   \label{eq:4}
%   A_{i0} &= (I_{k_{i}} - \Lambda_{i0}) \\
%   A_{il} &= \Phi_{il}\Lambda_{il}
% \end{align}
% for $l = 1,\ldots, p$.

% The weakly exogenous (foreign) variables are given by
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:5}
%   x_{i,t}^{*} = \sum_{j\ne i}w_{ij} x_{j,t}
% \end{equation}
% where $w_{ij}$ are the cross-country weights.




\subsection{Vector autoregression model}
The basic vector autoregression (VAR) model is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:6}
  y_{t} = A_{0}(t) + A(\ell)Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
where $y_{t}$ is a $k\times 1$ vector of endogenous variables for a given unit at time $t\in \{1,\ldots, T\}$,
$A_{0}(t)$ captures the deterministic components and 
$A(\ell)$ is a polynomial in the lag operator and $\varepsilon_{t}\sim iid(0,\Sigma_{\varepsilon})$ are random disturbances.
This framework allows for specification of both dynamic and static interdependencies
among the endogenous variables, as well as cross-sectional heterogeneities.
Country-specific VAR models can also be stacked to yield a global VAR or panel VAR \trbcite{martin2017weighting,dees2007exploring,covid19b}.
% In this case, the domestic variables are as follows (growth rates computed as difference of logs):
% \begin{itemize}
% \item COVID cases $y_{1}$
% \item driving $y_{2}$
% \item transit $y_{3}$
% \item walking $y_{4}$
% \item retail and recreation $y_{5}$
% \item grocery and pharmacy $y_{6}$
% \item parks $y_{7}$
% \item transit stations $y_{8}$
% \item work $y_{9}$
% \item home $y_{10}$
% \end{itemize}


\section{Results and Discussion}
Our clustering procedure based on the activity and mobility trends of 63 countries optimally yields four clusters (\autoref{fig:dend}).
Clusters 1 and 2 are much smaller than the other two, with 9 and 11 members, respectively.

We perform a time series transformation of the community mobility data. Google clusters their baseline trends around zero which affects our log differencing.
Therefore, we shift all of the movement indicators such as workplace, residential and transit by 100 which is also consistent with Apple's approach of keeping track of requests for directions.

There is no strong continental dominance in any one of the clusters.
This indicates at least there is geographic heterogeneity in the distribution of these trends as observed by Google location and Apple navigation-based data.
We note that these variables are only a partial observation of the true activity/mobility trends across these dimensions, given that only a select proportion in each country uses Google devices with location data turned on, or Apple devices for navigation.
Further, these samples may be more representative of urban or suburban populations in some countries than in others.
Nevertheless, some useful insights may still be gained.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  %\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,trim={0cm 0 1.9cm 7cm},clip]{dendrogram}
  \caption{Dendrogram indicating four clusters of countries based on nine mobility and activity indicators}
  \label{fig:dend}
\end{figure}

We then plot the trends of activity changes as observed from Google location data, grouping these by cluster (\autoref{fig:act}).
Trends are shown by means of a generalized linear model estimated for each country.
Except in Cluster 1, which consists notably of South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Vietnam (countries with some of the best COVID-19 outcomes),
there was a signifcant downturn in work activities from mid-February to early April.
This decrease is as great as 75 percentage points in Clusters 2 and 3.
However, in Cluster 4 (e.g.\ United States, Brazil, Japan), it only reaches 50 percentage points.
The change in work activities can be seen as a partial indicator of lockdown policies or behavioral responses to the pandemic in each of the countries.
Transit activities similarly reduced in Clusters 2 and 3, but not as severely in Cluster 4.
Notably, in Cluster 1, transit stop activities dipped the lowest in South Korea compared to the other countries.
This outcome can be readily understood given that South Korea focused heavily on contact tracing to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 \trbcite{aum2020covid19,parkearly}.

Grocery shopping experienced a downturn in most countries. However, Clusters 1 and 4 show the smallest disruptions (a decline of about 20 percentage points).
The same trend is observed for retail activities.
However, in Cluster 4, this category had a more severe downturn (as many as 60 percentage points from the baseline), compared to grocery shopping.
This could be explained by policies keeping grocery stores open as essential services, while other retail outlets were shut.
Also, home activities (people staying in their places of residence) increased across all countries, peaking in April and then declining thereafter.
The change from baseline was greatest in Cluster 3 (generally over 50 percentage points), indicating that countries in this cluster stayed at home the most.
Furthermore, the peak for home activities occurs the latest in Cluster 3.

There are no discernible cluster-specifc patterns for park activities for Clusters 1, 2 and 4 (as trends vary by country).
However, in Cluster 3, many countries observed a decline of up to 75 percentage points through April, followed by a large uptick.

  \label{fig:act}
\end{figure}


The driving, transit and walking activities observed from navigation via Apple devices do not distinctly vary among the clusters (\autoref{fig:mob}).
This could be explained by the fact that usual activities perhaps do not require navigation.
And also since Apple Maps users are not always representative of the population, it is less likely that changes in regular activities would be discernible from these data.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Limitations}
No strictly or weakly exogenous variables are included in our model.
Further, there are other variables that can explain COVID-19 impacts not explicitly accounted for, particularly interventions.
These can be included as strictly exogenous variables in a future model.
Air passenger travel flows can also be incorporated as weights on weakly exogenous (foreign) variables. This would provide linkages between countries which can be used to develop a global VAR model in the future.


\section{Conclusion and future work}

We cluster the countries in our sample into four categories based on similar activity and mobility trends.
By running the model with a different lag parameter for each country we attempted to estimate the optimal lag for each country.
However, our VAR implementation fell short of producing statistically significant results. Future work will focus on adding exogenous and weakly exogenous variables such as interventions and restrictions (social distancing orders, travel bans, etc.) as well as deterministic ones (country characteristics). We also plan to substitute the number of new cases with a moving average for new COVID-19 cases which would produce more robust results.
